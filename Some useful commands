inverse kinematics in moveit is computed using the "compute_ik" service call. The compute_ik is defined as IK_SERVICE_NAME in the file capability_names.h (/src/moveit/moveit_ros/move_group/include/moveit/move_group) and it calls the kinematics_service_capability.cpp(/src/moveit/moveit_ros/move_group/src/default_capabilities) which has the function definition for IK.
